Types:
	Enchantments
	Lands
		When you draw a land, 
	Creatures
	Artifacts?
	Spells
	On-Draw One-offs
		Tap
		Shuffle
		Encounters
			Enemy creatures
			Challenges
			etc


When you draw an Encounter, time starts
You have until time runs out to prepare for it
When time runs out, actions are executed
If you beat the Encounter you get a prize
If you lose, the Encounted dictates the cost


Deck is infinite, progress is gated by encounters
Next X cards are predetermined on a rolling basis (draw a card, a new predetermined card is added to the end)
